To get started with Angular, you will need to have Node.js and the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) installed on your computer.

Install Node.js by downloading the installer from the official website (https://nodejs.org/)
Open the command prompt and run the command npm install -g @angular/cli to install the Angular CLI.
Run the command ng new project-name to create a new Angular project with the name "project-name".
Run the command cd project-name to navigate into the project directory.
Run the command ng serve to start a local development server.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to see the running application.
You can now start building your Angular application by editing the files in the "src" folder. To learn more about Angular, you can refer to the official documentation at (https://angular.io/docs)
